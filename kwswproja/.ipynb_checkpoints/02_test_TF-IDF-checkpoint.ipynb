       "{\"title\":\"Medical Marijuana Works \",\"body\":\"If you lived in Britain in the 19th century and you were suffering from some aches and pains cramps sleeping problems or nausea the odds are that you would wander down to your local apothecary hand over a few pennies or even shillings and take home a bottle of tincture of laudanum And it worked so well that Britain was consuming tons of the stuff every year Women used it to alleviate menstrual pains stressed out businessmen took it to calm them down nurses served it by the spoonful to babies to ease the pain of teething Since laudanum was little more than a solution of opium in pure alcohol and the British were happily downing vast quantities of it did the country go completely down the pan Well not quite in fact helped along by vast quantities of alkaloid drugs and the fact that few of them ever drew a sober breath after the age of six the British went out and built the biggest empire that the world has ever seen Unfortunately there was a major problem with laudanum There were many different manufacturers with many different quality standards some excellent and some downright criminal so the purity of the drug varied enormously which meant that it was very difficult deciding just what was a correct dose and what was an excessive one Add this to the fact that a the alkaloids in opium are very highly poisonous and b basing the medicine on alcohol made it incredibly popular countless numbers of happy imbibers took just a little too much and ended up dead There was no such problem with another popular drug marijuana which worked very well indeed for a similar list of complaints and since it was smoked rather than ingested the effect was almost instantaneous Far from being poisonous however there has never been a recorded case of anyone dying of marijuana poisoning and it has been calculated that a user would have to to smoke approximately half a ton of cannabis within about 10 minutes in order to absorb a fatal dose The slight flaw in the ointment was that many people found it a little bit too relaxing and got into the habit of lying back smoking weed instead of working to pay their taxes and support their families so hardly surprisingly it was banned during the early 20th century and it is probably a complete coincidence that Britain lost its empire before that century was out What could not be ignored however was that cannabis had certain medical advantages which had been recognized for about 4000 years but health services throughout the world could hardly give people suffering from pain a handful of dried leaves to smoke so eventually the active psychotic ingredient in marijuana THC was isolated and then manufactured synthetically Unfortunately it did not work as well as smoking the leaf possibly because the cannabis plant contains many other alkaloids as well as THC and it is possible that these were having a synergistic effect It was not long before people suffering from cancer or multiple sclerosis were being hauled before the courts for smoking marijuana in order to ease their pains or the nausea caused by chemotherapy The government many of whose members I suspect had sampled marijuana in their youth eventually downgraded the penalties for possession and use of the drug Is this an argument for the complete legalisation of cannabis No There are definite provable links between cannabis use and psychosis although to be fair it is reasonable to ask which came first did psychotic people take up cannabis for recreational use or did recreational use of cannabis cause psychosis Statistics can of course be used to prove any argument whatsoever The fact that it is an illegal drug in most countries of the world however makes it very difficult indeed to collect meaningful statistics on the medical benefits as well as the undesirable side effects of cannabis use and the only positive statement that we can make is that for the relief of many very distressing symptoms it works works quickly and side effects are usually minimal and non toxic  marijuana, medical, works\",\"url\":\"medicalmarijuanaworks org\"}

Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor responsible for this story Tom
