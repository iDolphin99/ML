alone and not protein appeared to contribute to an increase in body fat according to a study in the January 4 issue of JAMA The researchers also found that protein did contribute to changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass Obesity has become a major public health concern with more than 60 percent of adults in the United States categorized as overweight and more than 30 percent as obese according to background information in the article The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation is unclear George A Bray M D of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center Baton Rouge La and colleagues conducted a study to determine whether the level of dietary protein differentially affected body composition weight gain or energy expenditure under tightly

participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007 After consuming a weight stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days participants were randomized to receive diets containing 5 percent of energy from protein low protein 15 percent normal protein or 25 percent high protein which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10 to 12 week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period the protein diets provided approximately 40 percent more energy intake which corresponds to 954 calories a day All participants in the study gained weight and there were no differences by sex The rate of weight gain in the low protein diet group was significantly less than in the other 2 groups 6 97 lbs 3 16 kg vs 13 3 lbs 6 05 kg for the normal protein diet group and 14 4 lbs 6 51 kg in the high protein diet group Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50 percent to more than 90 percent of the excess stored calories Resting energy expenditure total energy expenditure and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet the authors write Lean body mass body protein decreased during the overeating period by 1 5 lbs 0 70 kg in the low protein diet group compared with a gain of 6 3 lbs 2 87 kg in the normal protein diet group and 7 lbs 3 18 kg in the high protein diet group Resting energy expenditure normal protein diet 160 calories day high protein diet 227 calories day increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets In summary weight gain when eating a low protein diet 5 percent of energy from protein was blunted compared with weight gain when eating a normal protein diet 15 percent of energy from protein with the same number of extra calories Calories alone however contributed to the increase in body fat In contrast protein contributed to the changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass but not to the increase in body fat the researchers write The key finding of this study is that calories are more important than protein while consuming excess amounts of energy with respect to increases in body fat

Li M D Ph D and David Heber M D Ph D of the University of California Los Angeles write that the results of this study informs primary care physicians and policy makers about the benefits of protein in weight management The results suggest that overeating low protein diets may increase fat deposition leading to loss of lean body mass despite lesser increases in body weight Policy makers and primary care physicians need to understand the role of the Western diet in promoting overweight and obesity Because this diet increases the risks of overnutrition through fat deposition beyond that detected by body mass index the method used to assess the current obesity epidemic and the magnitude of the obesity epidemic may have been underestimated Clinicians should consider assessing a patient s overall fatness rather than simply measuring body weight or body mass index and concentrate on the potential complications of excess fat accumulation The goals for obesity treatment should involve fat reduction rather than simply weight loss along with a better understanding of nutrition science JAMA 2012 307 1 86 87 Available pre embargo to the media at www jamamedia org Editor s Note Please see

a Cheesecake CHEESECAKE Though a cheesecake can be savory and served with crackers as an appetizer most of us think of the term as describing a luscious rich dessert The texture of any cheesecake can vary greatly from light and airy to dense and rich to smooth and creamy All cheesecakes begin with cheese usually cream cheese ricotta cheese cottage cheese or sometimes Swiss or cheddar cheese A cheesecake may or may not have a crust which can be a light dusting of bread crumbs a cookie crust or a pastry crust The filling is made by creaming the cheese and mixing it with eggs sugar for desserts and other flavorings The mixture is then poured into a special springform pan and baked After baking the cheesecake is thoroughly chilled and generally topped by sour cream whipped cream fruit or some other embellishment Copyright c 1995 by Barron s Educational Series from The New Food Lover s Companion Second Edition by Sharon Tyler Herbst What Is Cream Cheese Cream Cheese Thanks to American ingenuity cream cheese the most popular ingredient for cheesecake was developed in 1872 The appellation comes from the smooth creamy texture of this mildly tangy spreadable cheese The soft unripened cheese is made from cow s milk and by law must contain at least 33 percent milk fat and not more than 55 percent moisture Gum arabic is added to some cream cheese to increase firmness and shelf life American neufch\\u00e2tel cheese is slightly lower in calories because of a lower milk fat content about 23 percent It also contains slightly more moisture Light or lowfat cream cheese has about half the calories as the regular style and nonfat cream cheese has zero fat grams The easily spreadable whipped cream cheese has been made soft and fluffy by air being whipped into it It has fewer calories per serving than regular cream cheese only because there s less volume per serving Cream cheese is sometimes sold mixed with other ingredients such as herbs spices or fruit Refrigerate cream cheese tightly wrapped and use within a week after opening If any mold develops on the surface discard the cream cheese From The New Food Lover s Companion Second Edition by Sharon Tyler Herbst HOW TO SOFTEN CREAM CHEESE Place completely unwrapped packages of cream cheese in microwavable bowl Microwave on High 30 to 45 seconds or until slightly softened CHEESECAKE TIPS AND IDEAS 1 A springform pan with removable side and bottom is the most commonly used pan for making cheesecakes 2 Avoid over beating the batter Over beating incorporates additional air and tends to cause cracking on the surface of the cheesecake 3 For even marbling and the best distribution of added ingredients such as chocolate chips or nuts do not over soften or over beat the cream cheese 4 Avoid over baking Cheesecake baking times are not always exact due to variations in ovens The cheesecake will continue to bake after it is removed from the oven The center of the cheesecake should be just slightly moist when it is ready to be removed 5 Upon removal from the oven loosen the cake from the edge of the pan by running the tip of a knife or narrow spatula between the top edge of the cake and the side of the pan This allows the cake to pull away freely from the pan as it cools 6 Cool the cheesecake on a wire rack away from drafts 7 After a cheesecake has cooled completely gently loosen the entire side of the cheesecake from the pan with the tip of a knife while slowly releasing the springform pan clamp Carefully remove the side of the pan 8 Baked cheesecakes freeze well Cool them completely and wrap them securely in heavy duty foil or plastic wrap but do not freeze cheesecakes with garnishes or toppings More Cheesecake Success Hints PREVENTING SURFACE CRACKS The most common complaint is cracking that develops through the middle of the cheesecake during or after baking To Prevent Surface Cracking Bake the cheesecake in a water bath to keep the oven moisture high and the heat gentle A water bath is using a larger pan containing water in which to place the smaller cheesecake baking pan Don t overbake the cheesecake When perfectly done there will still be a two to three inch wobbly spot in the middle of the cheesecake the texture will smooth out as it cools Cheesecake will shrink as it cools Generously greasing the sides of the baking pan before pouring in batter will allow the cake to pull away from the pan as it cools and shrinks instead of pulling apart from the middle Cheesecakes have a tendency to crack but they don t have to This favorite American dessert can have a cracked surface for a number of reasons One cause is air trapped inside the batter a result of over mixing Once in the oven the air bubble expands and wants to escape from the cake As it finds its way out of the top of the cake it creates a crack or crevice in the cake s surface Another cause of a cracked surface is a drastic temperature change How to avoid cracks then Be sure to mix your cheesecake batter well eliminating all possible lumps in the cream cheese BEFORE you add the eggs It is the eggs that will hold air in the batter so add them last and mix as little as possible once they are in the mix Also be sure to cook your cheesecake gently Use a water bath wrap the bottom of your springform pan in aluminum foil and place it in a larger pan with water in it just halfway up the outside of the springform pan This will allow the cheesecake to cook more slowly and evenly Finally cook your cheesecake slowly at 325\\u00ba F After about 45 minutes turn your oven off and leave the cheesecake inside the turned off oven for another hour Cool at room temperature with a plate or cookie sheet inverted over the cheesecake to slow the cooling Only then can you refrigerate the cake which you will need to do for another 6 hours at least If after all this you still have a crack make a topping or a sauce for your cheesecake and tell all your guests that you intentionally made a special crack in the top of the cake to hold more sauce VERY IMPORTANT TIPS ON PREVENTING CRACKING Cheesecakes with cornstarch or flour added to the batter do not crack as easily from overbaking The starch molecules will actually get in between the egg proteins preventing them from over coagulating No over coagulating no cracks Some bakers add extra insurance to a cheesecake recipe that doesn t contain cornstarch or flour by simply adding 1 tablespoon to1 4 cup of cornstarch to the batter with the sugar With today s trend to produce larger and higher cheesecakes and to bake them without the benefit of a waterbath they tend to overbake at the edge before the center of the cake has reached the temperature necessary to set coagulate the eggs Here your cheesecake will tend to form deep cracks upon cooling Don t bake your cheesecake at too high a temperature I recommend baking cheesecakes at 300 325 degrees F at the highest The egg proteins will overcoagulate from too much heat which eventually shrink when cooled causing cracking usually in its center or tiny cracks all over its top If you heat it up to fast or cool it down too fast you re also going to get cracks Freezing Cheesecakes Cheesecakes can be frozen Careful wrapping is very important To freeze place a fully cooled cheesecake in the freezer uncovered for 1 hour If it s in a springform pan remove sides of pan and freeze with the pan bottom in place After 1 hour use a knife to separate the cheesecake from the pan bottom Slide it onto a foil wrapped piece of heavy cardboard Wrap in plastic wrap then carefully place it inside a large freezer bag or wrap it in heavy duty aluminum foil Label and date Freezing for more than a month is not recommended to retain the best quality For a cheesecake with topping such as fruit always freeze cheesecake WITHOUT the topping and add the topping before serving Always thaw a cheesecake overnight in the refrigerator When partially thawed transfer it from the cardboard bottom to a serving plate Water Bath For Baking Cheesecakes A water bath is a method that will help keep your cheesecake from cracking while baking Instructions For Water Bath First take heavy aluminum foil and wrap it around sides and bottom of your springform pan or cheesecake pan with removable bottom This prevents leakage while baking your cheesecake Place your springform pan or cheesecake pan filled with cheesecake batter and crust into a larger deep baking pan that it will fit into easily Note The larger pan should be at least 2 3 inches in depth Place in pre heated oven With a kettle filled with very hot water pour water into the larger pan about halfway up or approximately 1 1 2 to 2 inches Bake cheesecake as directed When cheesecake is done remove springform pan or cheesecake pan if using from water bath in oven Carefully remove larger pan with water in it from oven It will be very hot Discard water when it has cooled Remove aluminim foil from sides and bottom of pan after your cheescake has cooled completely in the refrigerator When you are ready to release sides of springform pan or remove cheesecake from a cheesecake pan with removable bottom if using and cheescake has cooled in refrigerator at least 4 hours or overnight this is the best time to remove aluminum foil dianas desserts is dedicated to home bakers. here you will find my recipes, recipes

obsession with sugar, salt and fat\",\"body\":\"Did you know that the food industry has created different kinds of salt to fit their specific products STORY HIGHLIGHTS Average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar a year The optimum amount of sugar in a product is known as the bliss point Food industry is hooked on salt author says as a miracle ingredient to solve problems Expert says it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics TIME com In his new book Salt Sugar Fat Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter Michael Moss takes readers on a tour of the 1 trillion processed food industry and the sights aren t pretty The average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar a year and health experts say those trends triggered the obesity epidemic that has left millions at risk of heart disease diabetes and other chronic health conditions Based on his interviews with top industry executives from Kraft to Coca Cola as well as leading food scientists Moss discusses how we became so dependent on processed food How does covering the food industry compare to your other investigative reporting projects In some ways the food companies are fortresses They share so little of what they do with nosy reporters At the same time I kind of discovered that food companies are in some ways are like hotels When you really start meeting the people inside who work there there are few precious secrets People really do love to talk about their work I was also incredibly fortunate to come across thousands and thousands of pages of internal documents that shed huge light on the dark corners in the processed food industry and convinced some of the key executives to talk me It s pretty widely known that sugary cereals and Cheese Whiz are not good for you What surprised you One of the things that really surprised me was how concerted and targeted the effort is by food companies to hit the magical formulation Take sugar for example The optimum amount of sugar in a product became known as the bliss point Food inventors and scientists spend a huge amount of time formulating the perfect amount of sugar that will send us over the moon and send products flying off the shelves It is the process they ve engineered that struck me as really stunning When it came to fat it was the amazing role of what the industry calls the mouth feel That s the warm gooey taste of cheese or the bite into a crisp fried chicken that you get It rushes right to the same pleasure centers of the brain that sugar does but fat is carrying twice as many calories so it is more problematic from an obesity standpoint There is almost no limit to the bliss point in fat If there is one it s up in heavy cream some place So the companies discovered they could add as much fat as they wanted to products and unless people looked closely at the nutrition facts they are going to totally love it more than they would without the fat When it comes to salt what was really staggering to me is that the industry itself is totally hooked on salt It is this miracle ingredient that solves all of their problems There is the flavor burst to the salt itself but it also serves as a preservative so foods can stay on the shelves for months It also masks a lot of the off notes in flavors that are inherent to processed foods TIME com Why are Americans still obese After all your research do you believe these foods can be considered addictive That is the one single word that the food industry hates addiction They much prefer words like crave ability and allure Some of the top scientists who are very knowledgeable about addiction in the country are very convinced that for some people the most highly sugared high fat foods are every bit as addictive as some narcotics Their advice to these people is don t try to eat just a couple Oreo cookies because you are not going to be able to stop Sugar uses the same neurological pathways as narcotic products rely on to hit the pleasure center of the brain that send out the signals eat more eat more That said the food industry defends itself by saying true narcotic addiction has certain technical thresholds that you just don t find in food addiction It s true but in some ways getting unhooked on foods is harder than getting unhooked on narcotics because you can t go cold turkey You can t just stop eating The head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington says that it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics She is hugely empathic with overeaters In your book you talk about how the industry fiddles with the physical shapes of ingredients like fat and salt so they taste better on the tongue How are companies using this process Cargill among other companies make numerous versions of salt to meet the particular needs of their customers and their products I had this vision of salt as chunks coming out of the ground and then thrown into a box But in fact they re manipulated to work perfectly with every special product There are powdered salts chunked salts salts shaped in different ways with various additives to work perfectly with processed foods All of them are geared to increase allure My favorite is the one called the kosher salt It looks like snow but is shaped like a pyramid with flat sides that enable it to stick to food better But where the magic comes in is that it s hollowed out so your saliva has more contact with the salt Your saliva is what conveys the salt taste to the taste buds which send the electric signals to your brain The kosher salt also dissolves three times as fast as regular salt so you re getting a much larger hit of what the companies call the flavor burst I thought that was truly fascinating You focus heavily on the success of Lunchables to appeal to kids What fascinated you about their creation Lunchables was an incredible stroke of marketing genius Especially when they came up with the idea of making pizza Lunchables They asked mothers whether they thought their kids would eat this cold pizza that they assembled themselves and the mothers said Are you kidding me That sounds so awful But when they turned to the kids and asked Hey what do you guys think the kids said Yeah That sounds really interesting They realized that the overwhelming attraction to the Lunchables wasn t the taste It s the empowerment It s about letting kids have control and manipulate what they re eating They came up with this brilliant Lunchable slogan which was All day you have to do what they say but lunch time is all yours That resonated deeply with children and sales just went through the roof The darker side of Lunchables is that it brought fast food into the grocery store which has become a real concern given the obesity crisis The CDC put out a recent report saying consumption of fast food has declined from 13 of our calories to 11 There is some reason to believe that it was due to the recession because people were trying to cut back on going out to eat The question is what are they substituting for that fast food If you look at grocery stores in the last decade or more there s been an increase in foods that try and emulate fast foods It s like the industry has moved into the grocery store TIME com Cutting soda curbs children s weight gain Were you surprised by how many scientists and food company executives avoid their own products It was everything from a former top scientist at Kraft saying he used to maintain his weight by jogging and then he blew out his knee and couldn t exercise his solution was to avoid sugar and all caloric drinks including all the Kool Aid and sugary drinks that Kraft makes It ranged from him to the former top scientist at Frito Lay I spent days at his house going over documents relating to his efforts at Frito Lay to push the company to cut back on salt He served me plain cooked oatmeal and raw asparagus for lunch We toured his kitchen and he did not have one single processed food product in his cupboards or refrigerator The scientists and executives were pretty honest about their roles in creating unhealthy food Did you get the impression they felt guilty about their products One reason they don t eat their own products is that they know better They know about the addictive properties of sugar salt and fat As insiders they know too much I think a lot of them have come to feel badly But not blaming themselves necessarily because the older ones invented a number of these products back in the days when dependency on them was much lower In the 70s and the 80s for example we were eating more home cooked meals from scratch and eating more mindfully As society evolved and we became more dependent on these conveniences these people came to see their work with real misgivings The inventor of the Lunchables Bob Drane wishes mightily that the nutritional aspects of that product could ve been made better He is still hoping it will be made better They came to have regrets about their work in the context of the health effects their products seem to have that go hand in hand with society s increasing demand of their products You highlight some examples of companies trying to make their food healthier Are there any changes you find particularly positive I was really struck by the concerted effort by Kraft to embrace an anti obesity initiative At first they tried to rally the whole industry to collectively cut back and try to fight obesity including down formulating the amount of salt sugar and fats they were using But when that failed and the rest of the companies refused to join Kraft set off on its own It cut back on its marketing of sugary products to children and rejiggered it s packaging so it would tell people how much salt sugar and fat in calories were in each package not just in a tiny little serving The most revolutionary thing was that they ordered their food scientists to limit the salt sugar and fat in their products This was a company where every ounce of their effort for decades and decades had gone into making products as hugely appealing and addictive as possible Mind you these are not companies that want people to get fat or unhealthy that s not in their business interests but they do want people to buy as much of their products as they possibly can To have Kraft then say to itself Wait a minute maybe there s some other competing interest to pay attention to was mind blowing Ultimately they ran into the problem that the whole industry faces which is the huge pressure from Wall Street and the investment community to increase profits TIME com The 31 healthiest foods of all time What do you think is the greatest obstacle standing in the way of federal regulation of salt sugar and fat I think the USDA is badly conflicted It has multiple missions and one of the biggest is to support the agricultural industry This plays out most significantly in the area of cheese and beef The USDA has become a partner with the dairy industry and the beef industry in promoting increased consumption of cheese and red meat at a time when its own nutritionists are encouraging people to cut back because both are heavily laden with saturated fat which is linked to heart disease This largely explains why cheese consumption has tripled in this country since the 70s to as much as 33 pounds per person per year On the flipside the USDA has this tiny little operation that creates things like the food pyramid and dietary guidelines to encourage people to limit their consumption of saturated fat but the budget for those efforts is miniscule compared to budget for promoting consumption One of the key things for moving forward is that the playing field needs to be leveled in terms of pricing We all know we should be eating more fresh vegetables and fresh fruits When you hit that part of the store and you see that blueberries cost 5 for a little basket and you can wheel over to the center of the store and see all these power bars and seemingly healthy things that are in fact loaded with salt sugar and fat and they are half the price or a third the price and there are all these other things that can fill up your cart for much less money That s a really difficult thing for families to deal with Everyone is convinced that the government subsidies that support processed food need to be shifted over in some way to fresh fruits and vegetables or it s going to continue to be hard for even people who want to eat better to do so financially Do you think there s any change in sight I think we are at a real tipping point here What I hear from people inside the food industry is that the food giants are scared to death right now The pressure from Wall Street on profits has never been greater The pressure from consumers for better healthier products has never been greater The pressure from the White House to do something to fight obesity is increasing The other problem they re having is that they ve cut way back on the pure science and research that they used to do and so many of the scientists I ve talked to are pleading with these companies to start putting more money into inventing new products that both taste good and are healthy I think that will be key to getting out of this mess we are in Have any of your eating and purchasing habits changed since writing this I have two boys age 8 and 13 and it certainly makes things difficult My wife like so many people works outside the home like I do and our mornings are totally crazy That said we ve been working on breakfast We get the boys to eat 100 whole wheat toast and they really don t notice the difference between white bread and wheat We arbitrarily set a limit on cereals of 5g of sugar per serving which they find kind of fun because they can go into the cereal aisles and hunt for cereals that have that much sugar or less They may have to reach low or reach high to find them because they re not at eye level but basic Cherrios have one gram per serving which is fantastic and they love it If you engage kids in the process of getting healthier they rise to the occasion They are smart and they re eager TIME com Make over your diet in one week Do you have any advice for people going into the grocery store who want to eat healthier Make a list and stick to it Some of the plotting done by grocery stores and food manufacturers is to get you into situations where you are making spontaneous decisions That s when the soda and the sugary foods around the check counter get sold most heavily Spend more time on the ends of the supermarket near the fresh vegetable and fresh fruit aisle and look for things that are affordable When you get into the center aisle be careful in the middle part because that s the highest selling area and where they put the most heavily laden salt and sugary products Also look first at the front of the packaging That s where they hit you with things like low fat and low sugar and added calcium and vitamin this and vitamin that Take those as warning signs When they say low fat it s often loaded with sugar to make up for the reduction in fat Or likewise low salt is often loaded with sugar and fat to make up for the low salt When they splash the phrase added calcium on the front that s often a signal that the thing is loaded in all three of the pillars Lastly spend some time with the nutrition facts box It has to be on every package now It can be really revealing as to what exactly is in the package Pay attention to the number of servings per container because the companies know that people will typically eat a package of cookies that has three servings in it all at once You have to do the math yourself because they will list the nutrient content based on one serving which will dramatically understate the amount of nutrient load you re getting by eating the package Very few of us can avoid processed foods all together Our lives will not allow it I m certainly in that category But ultimately we are the ones who decide what to buy what to eat and how much to eat and that s a very powerful thing when we walk into the grocery store I hope the book can help people to understand everything the food giants are throwing at you in terms of formulating marketing and advertising I think you come away feeling more empowered to take control of that decision making process yourself This story was originally published on TIME com Salt Sugar Fat Q A With Author Michael Moss copy 2012 TIME Inc

mit technology review\",\"body\":\"One of the driving forces in modern science is the idea that the Universe computes the future taking some initial state as an input and generating future states as an output This is a powerful approach that has produced much insight Some scientists go as far as to say that the Universe is a giant computer Is this a reasonable assumption Today Ken Wharton at San Jose State University in California makes an important argument that it is not His fear is that the idea of the universe as a computer is worryingly anthropocentric It s basically the assumption that the way we humans solve physics problems must be the way the universe actually operates he says What s more the idea has spread through science without any proper consideration of its validity or any examination of the alternatives This assumption is so strong that many physicists can t even articulate what other type of universe might be conceptually possible says Wharton He argues that a close look at the notion of the cosmos as a computer reveals important problems Wharton examines several For example a computation involves three steps First the physical world has to be mapped onto some mathematical state Next this state mathematically evolves into a new state And finally the new state is mapped back onto the physical world In quantum mechanics this can only happen if this final step is probabilistic As Wharton puts it Not even the universe knows which particular outcome will occur And yet when the universe is measured a specific outcome does occur The operation of a computer cannot account for this For Wharton this is a crucial flaw that most physicists just overlook It s also an important clue that idea of the universe is a computer is merely an assumption and one that has never been rigorously questioned It is the least questioned and most fundamental assumptions that have the greatest potential to lead us astray he says The consequences of this are profound Thanks to this deep bias it s possible that we have missed the bigger picture the mounting evidence that the fundamental rules that govern our universe cannot be expressed in terms of a traditional computation To demonstrate the point Wharton spends a significant part of his paper explaining an alternative view of the cosmos which does not rely on traditional computation This is Lagrange s formulation of the laws of physics based on the principle of least action An example is the principle that light travels the shortest distance between two points Lagrange s method is essentially to stipulate the start point and end point examine all possible paths and choose the shortest In this view the reason light bends at an air water interface is not because of any algorithm like chain of cause and e\\ufb00ect but rather because it s globally more e\\ufb03cient explains Wharton Anybody familiar with this approach will know its great elegance and beauty But critics ask how the light ray can know its end point when it starts its journey Wharton says these critics argue like this Yes Lagrange s method may be beautiful it may be powerful but it s not how our universe really works It s just a useful trick we ve discovered But this argument is itself powerfully anthropocentric says Wharton It assumes the Universe must work in the way we solve problems that the Universe is as in the dark about the future as we are Of course there are plenty of good arguments for thinking that the Universe works like a conventional computer The point Wharton makes is that there are other ways of thinking about the cosmos too and that these may provide important new insights We ignore them at our peril Interesting reading Ref arxiv org abs 1211 7081 The Universe As Not A Computer the idea that

Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor responsible for this story Tom Giles at tgiles5 bloomberg net by 2015, your

races\",\"body\":\"And that can be carried on a plane without the hassle too The Omega E Gun Starting Pistol Omega It s easy to take for granted just how insanely close some Olympic races are and how much the minutiae of it all can matter The perfect example is the traditional starting gun Seems easy You pull a trigger and the race starts Boom What people don t consider When a conventional gun goes off the sound travels to the ears of the closest runner a fraction of a second sooner than the others That s just enough to matter and why the latest starting pistol has traded in the mechanical boom for orchestrated electronic noise Omega has been the watch company tasked as the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games since 1932 At the 2010 Vancouver games they debuted their new starting gun which is a far cry from the iconic revolvers associated with early games it s clearly electronic but still more than a button that s pressed to get the show rolling About as far away as you can get probably while still clearly being a starting gun Pull the trigger once and off the Olympians go If it s pressed twice consecutively it signals a false start Working through a speaker system is what eliminates any kind of advantage for athletes It s not a big advantage being close to a gun but the sound of the bullet traveling one meter every three milliseconds could contribute to a win Powder pistols have been connected to a speaker system before but even then runners could react to the sound of the real pistol firing rather than wait for the speaker sounds to reach them This year s setup will have speakers placed equidistant from runners forcing the sound to reach each competitor at exactly the same time It wouldn t be an enormous difference Omega Timing board member Peter H\\\\u00fcrzeler said in an email but when you think about reaction times being measured in tiny fractions of a second placing a speaker behind each lane has eliminated any sort of advantage for any athlete They all hear the start commands and signal at exactly the same moment There s also an ulterior reason for its look In a post September 11th world a gun on its way to a major event is going to raise more than a few TSA eyebrows even if it s a realistic looking fake Rather than deal with that the e gun can be transported while still maintaining the general look of a starting gun But there s still nothing like hearing a starting gun go off at the start of a race more than signaling the runners there s probably some Pavlovian response after more than a century of Olympic games that make people want to hear the real thing not a whiny electronic noise Everyone in the stands at home thankfully will still be getting that The sound is programmable and can be synthesized to sound like almost anything H\\\\u00fcrzeler says but we program it to sound like a pistol it s a way to use the best possible starting technology but to keep a rich tradition alive and that can be carried on a

simply wasn t getting enough of rest at night I didn t want to take medication and this led me to learn several tips and tricks that really helped me to overcome my insomnia Some of these tips I try to follow regularly Don t worry about not getting enough sleep Try not to worry about how much you sleep Such worrying can start a cycle of negative thoughts that contribute to a condition known as learned insomnia Learned insomnia occurs when you worry so much about whether or not you will be able to get adequate sleep that the bedtime rituals and behavior actually trigger insomnia Don t force yourself to sleep The very attempt of trying to do so actually awakes you making it more difficult to sleep Go to bed only when you are feeling really tired and sleepy Don t look at the alarm clock at night Looking at the clock promotes increased anxiety and obsession about time Body heating procedures Some studies suggest that soaking in hot water before going to bed can ease the transition into a deeper sleep Avoid oversleep Don t oversleep to make up for a poor night s sleep Doing so for even a couple of days can reset your body clock and make it harder for you to sleep at night Sex Sex is a well known nighttime stress reliever Healthy sex life enhances your relationship relaxes your body releases happy chemicals and even promotes wellness And it welcomes sleep Avoid alcohol as a sleeping aid Avoid the use of alcohol in the late evening The most common myth found among people is that they believe alcohol helps in the sleep But the fact is alcohol may initially act as sedative but it produces a number of sleep impairing effects in the long run Associate your bed and bedroom with sleep and sex only Don t watch TV eat or read in bed Although these things help some people sleep they can also give your brain the idea that bed isn t just for sleeping and this can keep you awake Naps If you suffer from insomnia try not taking a nap If the goal is to sleep more during the night napping may steal hours desired later on If you re a regular napper and experiencing difficulty falling or staying asleep at night give up the nap and see what happens Written by C Simmons of

Hockey League club is prepared to do whatever it takes to cement its name in history forever And that includes fashioning a Jackson Pollack esque display of paint madness More simply referred to as the Military Appreciation Jerseys Abstract art at its finest 45 Cincinnati Stingers Away Jersey This 70s World Hockey Association masterpiece can t possibly be gulped all at once It s too powerful Here is the rest 44 Kingston Frontenacs Don Cherry Jersey The Kingston Frontenacs are still several suits away from reaching greatness but the Ontario Hockey League just got a lot cooler with this mockery of NHL analyst and nut Don Cherry Risky business though as this can often be misconstrued as brutal 43 Atlanta Braves Throwback Jersey Worn by Hank Aaron and his pack of Braves during the franchise s first two seasons in Atlanta 1966 67 this simple off white piece of cloth is a pleasant vacation for the pupils With a player number replacing the chest high tomahawk and an iconic badge on the sleeve these jerseys present solid compliments to the everyday white and red 42 Montreal Canadiens Throwback Jersey When the Canadiens broke out their 1910 11 Centennial jerseys few were ready for such festive aggression An early Christmas present 41 Missouri Tigers New Jersey Forget the heart of a lion This Missouri squad is ready to prove they possess the mind of a Tiger Enhanced durability makes these cats ferocious 40 North Stars Jersey Minnesota enjoyed the green and yellow North Stars from 1967 to 1993 before they moved to Dallas and became the Stars Minnesota Wild 2000 present brass evidently decided not to follow suit 39 Pittsburgh Steelers Throwback Jersey If these 80th season jerseys truly are inspired by bumblebees then due credit goes to those talented honey dwellers They may be tough on the eyes but these obtuse jerseys are a refreshing and necessary addition to the NFL Only in doses though 38 France New Away Jersey The stripe work may seem excessive but let s be real You can never have enough stripes Just as long as France doesn t get mistaken for a pack of referees 37 Anaheim Ducks Goldberg Jersey David Wright continues to amaze us with his potent disregard for the routine This is no regular Ducks sweater But it s clearly phenomenal 36 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey These 1912 1913 throwbacks give us another reason to love stripes But we re still searching for Waldo 35 Turkey New Away Jersey Simple yet effective is the direction these designers seemed headed for The edgy lettering and gnarly ray of light shining from the back makes this potent presentation almost magical 34 Halifax Mooseheads Jersey The firm red shoulders pads curved lettering and complimentary script are the main ingredients for artistic brilliance The CHL is simply epic 33 California Golden Seals Jersey One of six teams added to the league as part of the 1967 NHL expansion the California Golden Seals never truly grasped the importance of winning on the ice they moved to Cleveland and became the Barons in 1976 They were clearly more focused on keeping their elegant white skates squeaky clean 32 Tampa Bay Lightning 3rd Jersey Released in 08 these silver trimmed knockouts are subtly intense It s refreshing The diagonal style lettering is a slight but necessary detail 31 Miami Heat Orange and Pink Jersey They only played in the ABA for two years 1968 1970 but that didn t keep today s superstars from remembering the Miami Floridians White pink orange black It might be too festive Though never too unique 30 Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 3rd Jersey Not only does the centerpiece bird look like a steroid struck or murderous version of Daffy Duck but he also appears ready to dominate the ice They re far from traditional and far from boring 29 Connecticut Whale Jersey Since 2010 this AHL uniform has dominated the competition The Hartford Whalers esque feel gives the Whale a mighty advantage on camera 28 Los Angeles Kings Throwback Jersey This purple and yellow elegance has rarely let down the illustrious Lakers so perhaps the Kings should turn back the clock and embrace their retro look Beating the Devils for the massive Stanley Cup would be a memorable first step to a new tradition 27 Maryland Terrapins New Jersey If the checkered oddly shaped new Maryland jerseys don t get your senses riled up perhaps their gold alternates will Loving the shoulder pad creativity at this moment although this wild flow may become a visual issue in the future 26 Portugal New Away Jersey The precise coloring cornered numbering and vibrant crosshairs make Portugal s new away kit one for the ages Quality over quantity 25 ZSC Lions Victoria Cup Jersey Founded in 1930 the ZSC Lions are clearly experienced in the art of victory But this Switzerland club proved they were more than just a stylish crew when they beat the Chicago Blackhawks in 2009 for the Victoria Cup trophy 24 Boston Bruins 3rd Jersey With a bear hogging the center there s little about this jersey that doesn t scream amazing We may despise Boston s hockey club but we love their Bruin 23 Washington Redskins Alternate Jersey These yellow and red studs are a refreshing clean cut addition to the often cliched gridiron fashion business Letter circling on the helmet makes this a knockout 22 Rutgers Scarlet Knights New Jersey Underneath this fresh style is an exuberant smile unable to contain itself Oh yes look closely The Scarlet Knights seem ready for battle 21 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey Word has it that this blue masterpiece was only worn for one year 1909 1910 but man what a year it was Time for a comeback 20 England New Away Jersey Rugby is already grueling enough but with a duel kit like this few others have a chance The staredown is classic 19 New York Rangers Heritage Jersey 18 Memphis Grizzlies Throwback Jersey As our eyes steadily adjust to the vibrant presentation it becomes clear that the Memphis Grizzlies have an intricate plan for victory Pleasantly distract all viewers 17 France New Home Jersey A ferocious blue display is perfectly complimented by slight gold lettering on the chest and sleeves Nike s new France home kit has all of Western Europe in a euphoric state 16 San Antonio Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they moved to San Antonio long before the Spurs decided to pay necessary tribute 15 New York Mets Throwback Jersey It seems the Mets have finally realized the atrocity surrounding their black uniforms A legendary NY scripted on their chest seals the deal Respect for baseball s former New York Giants 14 Quidditch Olympics Jersey The nerdiest sport on the planet just became perhaps the most fashionable as well with the introduction of their 2012 Summer Olympic tops Muggles may not possess the power to soar on broom sticks but they clearly know what it takes to look good 13 Oakland Athletics Throwback Jersey Just picture mustache extraordinaire Rollie Fingers sporting the green and yellow stirrups Truly kicking it old school 12 Chicago Blackhawks Throwback Jersey This 1936 inspired sweater does everything to escape the norm The tribal logo sets the tone while the cream white and red striping puts the finishing touches Epic 11 Texas Rangers Throwback Jersey This 1976 powder blue home uniform rests officially as one of the best to have ever graced the diamond The colorfully striped rims are a nice touch 10 Detroit Red Wings Throwback Jersey During their Cougar days Detroit s beloved franchise fashioned an intricate yet clean arsenal This eye pleasing presentation would define the Original Six and the NHL for years to come 9 Croatia New Home Jersey The design team designated to Croatia s EURO 2012 home kit seems to be simultaneously poking at greatness and insanity But let s be real this is pure genius 8 Ottawa Senators Heritage Jersey It must ve been tough for Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to contain his exuberance during this moment and we respect him for trying Sure the design is creatively perfect but it s the story behind the cloth that has us in a frenzy All it took was one suggestion from graphic designer Jacob Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented their spot in sports lore with five George Mikan led championships and vibrant suits Perfection 5 Great Britain New Olympics Jersey Thank you Leicester Riders forward and national team captain Andrew Sullivan for the pink touch The glistening top reeks of class and the solid neck of aggression Nicely done 4 Cleveland Cavaliers Hardwood Classic Jersey We saw the Cavs sport a blue and orange top during LeBron James days but not so much this retro piece The 1970 s wine and gold look is a keeper 3 Ohio State Buckeyes Throwback Jersey In honor of the 1954 Buckeyes team the Ohio State football team was seen repping these artistic keepers at Michigan Stadium several years back From the intricate sleeve work to the simple yet engaging helmets these uniforms epically compliment the gridiron 2 Golden State Warriors Throwback Jersey A faint blue and red trimming cements this less is more masterpiece in hardwood lore for good Purely classic 1 Brooklyn Dodgers Throwback Jersey What a brilliant shot for all Dodgers fans only in California of course The 1940 s road alternates help these West Coast superstars look the part
