Salt NPR can a diet clean out toxins in the body? : npr\",\"body\":\"Enlarge iStockphoto com Experts say specialized diets won t help rid the body of toxins any more than what the liver and kidneys already do every day iStockphoto com Experts say specialized diets won t help rid the body of toxins any more than what the liver and kidneys already do every day Between lingering New Year s resolutions and impending Lenten restraint it s the season when many people are inspired to get healthy by refusing foods they normally delight in And increasingly we re seeing elimination diets that promise weight loss and a tantalizing bonus detoxification Cleansing diets trade on this most alluring idea By limiting our intake of food to a few superpure items we can free up the body to get rid of all the gunk accumulated in our cells There s only one problem with the idea of using food or a lack thereof to detox Medical experts say it s baloney What s most ironic about the detox myth they say is that the body is already quite capable of eliminating toxins a gift from human evolution The body has its own amazing detoxification systems the liver and the kidneys says Ranit Mishori a faculty member in family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine who has reviewed the medical literature on colon cleanses Unless there s a blockage in one of these organs that do it day and night there s absolutely no need to help the body get rid of toxins I happen to know a few people who recently embarked on the Clean Program a 21 day diet created by Alejandro Junger who was once called the detox movement s It Boy A cardiologist by training the Uruguayan born Los Angeles based Junger has managed to sell a lot of books a best seller titled Clean The Revolutionary Program to Restore the Body s Natural Ability to Heal Itself and a lot of dietary supplements to people on his program One of Junger s fundamental arguments is that our body is full of toxins we ve picked up from food and the environment These toxins slow us down and make us sick As Junger recently tweeted a main cause of dysfunction in the body is the presence of obstacles toxins to the normal functioning of things However Junger writes it is possible to get rid of them by giving our digestive system a break That system is normally so busy breaking down irritating foods that it rarely has time to do the hard work of detox In effect Junger sees the average body on an average American diet akin to a dirty house that needs an occasional deep scrubbing His diet bans a laundry list of foods dairy sugar alcohol caffeine gluten nightshade vegetables soy and peanuts all foods he calls irritants to good digestion His website also actively encourages people to spend 425 on the Clean supplement package which comes in vanilla or chocolate flavor After several years of promoting the Clean Program Junger has hundreds of devotees who chatter on the Clean forum and elsewhere about feeling marvelous and indeed cleaner after the program like this writer from Outside That group of believers includes such celebrities as Donna Karan and Gwyneth Paltrow who recently launched her own 425 goop cleanse with Junger Despite its heavy restrictions it s not hard to see why Clean is compelling Who doesn t sometimes feel icky or bloated or displeased with his decision to wolf down a few too many cookies or french fries And surely there s a benefit to eating a lot more fruits and vegetables But will that change in diet really push out toxins The body is constantly filtering the toxins in alcohol food and medicines not storing them Boston dietitian Maria Adams tells The Salt So they re not going to build up I think the reason people feel better on a cleanse is probably just they re losing weight and are less bloated It s true there are plenty of very real toxins in the environment we could be exposed to the ultrafine particulate matter we inhale from dirty air asbestos from old homes or heavy metals like lead or mercury Unfortunately there s really no easy way to get these toxins out Chelation therapy may work for some metals but particulates in our lungs are probably there to stay says Mishori A lot of these are irreversible she says So why despite the science does the idea of cleansing with food remain so powerful We live in an era where there are daily assaults on our psyche and body so cleansing may give you a false sense of getting the gunk out says Mishori As for psychological gunk Try a little exercise and nature she says dietary cleanses that promise immediate detoxification are all the rage this time of year. but experts say the body is naturally quite good at getting rid of most toxins and doesn't need a lot of help. dietary cleanses that promise

Bread Baking Junkie \",\"body\":\"Recipe adapted from RecipeGirl Let me just say that I love Nutella It s sad but I had to travel all the way to Germany to discover it for the first time One of our friends there asked if I wanted to try it so I asked her what it was When she told me it was sort of like a chocolate y peanut butter I was instantly smitten I don t think it can really get much better than that I remember thinking how incredibly it was and how we really should get it in America You can imagine my dumbfounded ness when I later see it in my grocery store once we were back in the states Back when I first started the blog I had a Nutella banana bread on my list to make and it seems I have finally gotten around to it My initial plan was to just swirl the Nutella through my usual banana bread batter but when I saw this recipe I knew it would be even better The Nutella is actually mixed into a portion of the banana bread then swirled together with the original batter Because of the sour cream used this banana bread is always very moist and this was no different The Nutella and banana flavors both compliment each other really well without either being overpowering Between this and the caramel toffee version I don t think I will ever just make plain banana bread again Enjoy Nutella Banana BreadPrinter Friendly 1 2 cup salted butter1 1 2 cup sugar2 eggs1 4 cup

Members Jeffrey Lipton Past Members Evan Malone Dan Periard Dan Cohen Meredith Cutler Deborah Coulter Bellow is an edited excerpt from Hydrocolloid Printing A Novel Platform for Customized Food Production More examples and Materials can be found on the Fab Home Website Impact of Food SFF Few things are as natively intertwined with humanity as food which is essential to biological and social life Not only does food support life and underpin social relations but it also accounts for a substantial part of our economy As of 2008 Americans spent 1 02 trillion annually on food i e 9 6 of the nation s combined disposable personal incomes Solid Freeform Fabrication SFF has the potential to leverage its core strengths e g geometric complexity automated fabrication and make its mark on the culinary realm by transforming the way we produce and experience food Technological innovations are necessary however before these visions can be realized In addition to lowering barriers to SFF such as cost of the machine materials must be developed to feasibly enable a wide range of foods to be produced on SFF platforms Impact on Culinary Professionals Overview Food SFF would benefit the professional culinary domain primarily in two respects by lending new artistic capabilities to the fine dining domain and also by extending mass customization capabilities to the industrial culinary sector Impact on Culinary Professionals Fine Dining Fine dining chefs are continually developing new innovative techniques and seeking the enabling technologies that will help them push the boundaries of culinary art They innovate by harnessing non traditional ingredients such as hydrocolloids and by employing new tools pulled straight from the scientific community the result is culinary magic including flavored gelatin spheres with liquid centers sauce foams hot liquid deserts with flash frozen shells syringe extrudable meats and much more SFF promises to be the next important enabling technology in the fine dining realm SFF delivers new possibilities by lending this faction of culinary artists one of SFF s core capabilities fabrication of multi material objects with high geometric complexity As the barriers fall e g SFF machine prices have reduced nearly an order of magnitude in the last decade and non traditional ingredients gain credibility in the fine dining world e g hydrocolloids the question is not whether SFF will play an important role in the future of food but rather in what ways will it do so Examples of potential future applications include cakes with complex embedded 3D letters such that upon slicing the cake a message is revealed Or even a prime rib with a hidden message Perhaps an on demand customizable menu in which the dish is prepared in any 3D shape that the diner desires the diner can co create with the culinary artist in real time Impact on Culinary Professionals Industrial Production The second way in which SFF could benefit the professional culinary community is by enabling mass customization in the industrial culinary sector Today industrial food producers rely heavily on high throughput processes such as molding extrusion and die cutting These processes however are not amenable to mass customization i e the use of flexible manufacturing techniques to produce custom output in a low unit cost fashion Molding extrusion and die cutting each require substantial custom tooling and consequently producing custom output for low quantity runs is simply unfeasible This is precisely where SFF s inherent strengths can be leveraged producing food with custom complex geometries while maintaining cost effectiveness The cost effectiveness is enabled by the fact that SFF does not require custom tooling or extensive manual labor One potential future application is custom production of edible giveaways for example as marketing collateral for small corporate events Currently the cost of custom tooling prohibits low quantity custom production runs but with a flexible culinary production platform like SFF such production runs would be feasible Impact in the Home Overview Culinary professionals are more primed to adopt SFF than are homeowners however the implications for laypeople are even more profound The effect on laypeople is essentially twofold increasing productivity and injecting knowledge Impact in the Home Productivity Currently the average American spends more than 30 minutes per day preparing food according to USDA economists If food SFF were brought to the set and forget state requiring minimal human labor the average person could possibly realize time savings of 150 hours per year 3 8 workweeks per year Impact in the Home Injecting Knowledge The second way that food SFF could impact laypeople is by abstracting culinary knowledge and injecting it directly into the home The idea of abstracting knowledge is nothing new When chefs create new dishes and then write recipes they are effectively abstracting their knowledge and distilling it into a prescription for others to reproduce their work Nevertheless just like the skills a musician needs to effectively play a song from sheet music a recipe follower still needs non trivial skills to execute a recipe It is not only in the abstraction of knowledge but also in the execution of the prescription that SFF could have tremendous impact Just as MIDI software can offload musical skill by taking in digital sheet music and directly creating sound the SFF system could directly inject the skills necessary to follow a recipe end to end Laypeople don t have to know the first thing about musical notation valve key fret fingering or tonal theory to be able to utilize a stereo system to deliver a distilled version of a live musical performance directly into their home Likewise a layperson would not necessarily need to possess even basic culinary skills to employ an SFF system to create geometrically complex multi material food items Culinary knowledge and artistic skill of world renowned chefs can be abstracted to a 3D fabrication file and then used by laypeople to reproduce famous chefs work in the home Also expert knowledge of the world s leading nutritionists can be abstracted and encoded in 3D fabrication files to help laypeople eat more healthily without necessarily having to learn healthy cooking techniques or even understand nutritional principles such as caloric intake and protein balance SFF systems could even go one step further and deliver customized solutions SFF s core strength to each user that incorporate the individualized nature of nutritional needs For example a layperson may soon be able to upload a report of their daily activity from a pedometer and digital food log and the SFF system could use expert knowledge to print them a meal that fulfills their particular nutritional needs for the day While experts can currently offer advice on how to balance a nutritional program their influence falls short of delivering the end to end solution that only SFF system can provide from personalized design through fabrication Lipton J I Arnold D Nigl F Lopez N Cohen D L Noren Nils

Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor responsible for this story Tom Giles at tgiles5 bloomberg net by 2015, your

races\",\"body\":\"And that can be carried on a plane without the hassle too The Omega E Gun Starting Pistol Omega It s easy to take for granted just how insanely close some Olympic races are and how much the minutiae of it all can matter The perfect example is the traditional starting gun Seems easy You pull a trigger and the race starts Boom What people don t consider When a conventional gun goes off the sound travels to the ears of the closest runner a fraction of a second sooner than the others That s just enough to matter and why the latest starting pistol has traded in the mechanical boom for orchestrated electronic noise Omega has been the watch company tasked as the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games since 1932 At the 2010 Vancouver games they debuted their new starting gun which is a far cry from the iconic revolvers associated with early games it s clearly electronic but still more than a button that s pressed to get the show rolling About as far away as you can get probably while still clearly being a starting gun Pull the trigger once and off the Olympians go If it s pressed twice consecutively it signals a false start Working through a speaker system is what eliminates any kind of advantage for athletes It s not a big advantage being close to a gun but the sound of the bullet traveling one meter every three milliseconds could contribute to a win Powder pistols have been connected to a speaker system before but even then runners could react to the sound of the real pistol firing rather than wait for the speaker sounds to reach them This year s setup will have speakers placed equidistant from runners forcing the sound to reach each competitor at exactly the same time It wouldn t be an enormous difference Omega Timing board member Peter H\\\\u00fcrzeler said in an email but when you think about reaction times being measured in tiny fractions of a second placing a speaker behind each lane has eliminated any sort of advantage for any athlete They all hear the start commands and signal at exactly the same moment There s also an ulterior reason for its look In a post September 11th world a gun on its way to a major event is going to raise more than a few TSA eyebrows even if it s a realistic looking fake Rather than deal with that the e gun can be transported while still maintaining the general look of a starting gun But there s still nothing like hearing a starting gun go off at the start of a race more than signaling the runners there s probably some Pavlovian response after more than a century of Olympic games that make people want to hear the real thing not a whiny electronic noise Everyone in the stands at home thankfully will still be getting that The sound is programmable and can be synthesized to sound like almost anything H\\\\u00fcrzeler says but we program it to sound like a pistol it s a way to use the best possible starting technology but to keep a rich tradition alive and that can be carried on a

simply wasn t getting enough of rest at night I didn t want to take medication and this led me to learn several tips and tricks that really helped me to overcome my insomnia Some of these tips I try to follow regularly Don t worry about not getting enough sleep Try not to worry about how much you sleep Such worrying can start a cycle of negative thoughts that contribute to a condition known as learned insomnia Learned insomnia occurs when you worry so much about whether or not you will be able to get adequate sleep that the bedtime rituals and behavior actually trigger insomnia Don t force yourself to sleep The very attempt of trying to do so actually awakes you making it more difficult to sleep Go to bed only when you are feeling really tired and sleepy Don t look at the alarm clock at night Looking at the clock promotes increased anxiety and obsession about time Body heating procedures Some studies suggest that soaking in hot water before going to bed can ease the transition into a deeper sleep Avoid oversleep Don t oversleep to make up for a poor night s sleep Doing so for even a couple of days can reset your body clock and make it harder for you to sleep at night Sex Sex is a well known nighttime stress reliever Healthy sex life enhances your relationship relaxes your body releases happy chemicals and even promotes wellness And it welcomes sleep Avoid alcohol as a sleeping aid Avoid the use of alcohol in the late evening The most common myth found among people is that they believe alcohol helps in the sleep But the fact is alcohol may initially act as sedative but it produces a number of sleep impairing effects in the long run Associate your bed and bedroom with sleep and sex only Don t watch TV eat or read in bed Although these things help some people sleep they can also give your brain the idea that bed isn t just for sleeping and this can keep you awake Naps If you suffer from insomnia try not taking a nap If the goal is to sleep more during the night

Loving the shoulder pad creativity at this moment although this wild flow may become a visual issue in the future 26 Portugal New Away Jersey The precise coloring cornered numbering and vibrant crosshairs make Portugal s new away kit one for the ages Quality over quantity 25 ZSC Lions Victoria Cup Jersey Founded in 1930 the ZSC Lions are clearly experienced in the art of victory But this Switzerland club proved they were more than just a stylish crew when they beat the Chicago Blackhawks in 2009 for the Victoria Cup trophy 24 Boston Bruins 3rd Jersey With a bear hogging the center there s little about this jersey that doesn t scream amazing We may despise Boston s hockey club but we love their Bruin 23 Washington Redskins Alternate Jersey These yellow and red studs are a refreshing clean cut addition to the often cliched gridiron fashion business Letter circling on the helmet makes this a knockout 22 Rutgers Scarlet Knights New Jersey Underneath this fresh style is an exuberant smile unable to contain itself Oh yes look closely The Scarlet Knights seem ready for battle 21 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey Word has it that this blue masterpiece was only worn for one year 1909 1910 but man what a year it was Time for a comeback 20 England New Away Jersey Rugby is already grueling enough but with a duel kit like this few others have a chance The staredown is classic 19 New York Rangers Heritage Jersey 18 Memphis Grizzlies Throwback Jersey As our eyes steadily adjust to the vibrant presentation it becomes clear that the Memphis Grizzlies have an intricate plan for victory Pleasantly distract all viewers 17 France New Home Jersey A ferocious blue display is perfectly complimented by slight gold lettering on the chest and sleeves Nike s new France home kit has all of Western Europe in a euphoric state 16 San Antonio Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they moved to San Antonio long before the Spurs decided to pay necessary tribute 15 New York Mets Throwback Jersey It seems the Mets have finally realized the atrocity surrounding their black uniforms A legendary NY scripted on their chest seals the deal Respect for baseball s former New York Giants 14 Quidditch Olympics Jersey The nerdiest sport on the planet just became perhaps the most fashionable as well with the introduction of their 2012 Summer Olympic tops Muggles may not possess the power to soar on broom sticks but they clearly know what it takes to look good 13 Oakland Athletics Throwback Jersey Just picture mustache extraordinaire Rollie Fingers sporting the green and yellow stirrups Truly kicking it old school 12 Chicago Blackhawks Throwback Jersey This 1936 inspired sweater does everything to escape the norm The tribal logo sets the tone while the cream white and red striping puts the finishing touches Epic 11 Texas Rangers Throwback Jersey This 1976 powder blue home uniform rests officially as one of the best to have ever graced the diamond The colorfully striped rims are a nice touch 10 Detroit Red Wings Throwback Jersey During their Cougar days Detroit s beloved franchise fashioned an intricate yet clean arsenal This eye pleasing presentation would define the Original Six and the NHL for years to come 9 Croatia New Home Jersey The design team designated to Croatia s EURO 2012 home kit seems to be simultaneously poking at greatness and insanity But let s be real this is pure genius 8 Ottawa Senators Heritage Jersey It must ve been tough for Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to contain his exuberance during this moment and we respect him for trying Sure the design is creatively perfect but it s the story behind the cloth that has us in a frenzy All it took was one suggestion from graphic designer Jacob Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented their spot in sports lore with five George Mikan led championships and vibrant suits Perfection 5 Great Britain New Olympics Jersey Thank you Leicester Riders forward and national team captain Andrew Sullivan for the pink touch The glistening top reeks of class and the solid neck of aggression Nicely done 4 Cleveland Cavaliers Hardwood Classic Jersey We saw the Cavs sport a blue and orange top during LeBron James days but not so much this retro piece The 1970 s wine and gold look is a keeper 3 Ohio State Buckeyes Throwback Jersey In honor of the 1954 Buckeyes team the Ohio State football team was seen repping these artistic keepers at Michigan Stadium several years back From the intricate sleeve work to the simple yet engaging helmets these uniforms epically compliment the gridiron 2 Golden State Warriors Throwback Jersey A faint blue and red trimming cements this less is more masterpiece in hardwood lore for good Purely classic 1 Brooklyn Dodgers Throwback Jersey What a brilliant shot for all Dodgers fans only in California of course The 1940 s road alternates help these West Coast superstars look the part
