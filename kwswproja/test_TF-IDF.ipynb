Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan

plane without the hassle too The Omega E Gun Starting Pistol Omega It s easy to take for granted just how insanely close some Olympic races are and how much the minutiae of it all can matter The perfect example is the traditional starting gun Seems easy You pull a trigger and the race starts Boom What people don t consider When a conventional gun goes off the sound travels to the ears of the closest runner a fraction of a second sooner than the others That s just enough to matter and why the latest starting pistol has traded in the mechanical boom for orchestrated electronic noise Omega has been the watch company tasked as the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games since 1932 At the 2010 Vancouver games they debuted their new starting gun which is a far cry from the iconic revolvers associated with early games it s clearly electronic but still more than a button that s pressed to get the show rolling About as far away as you can get probably while still clearly being a starting gun Pull the trigger once and off the Olympians go If it s pressed twice consecutively it signals a false start Working through a speaker system is what eliminates any kind of advantage for athletes It s not a big advantage being close to a gun but the sound of the bullet traveling one meter every three milliseconds could contribute to a win Powder pistols have been connected to a speaker system before but even then runners could react to the sound of the real pistol firing rather than wait for the speaker sounds to reach them This year s setup will have speakers placed equidistant from runners forcing the sound to reach each competitor at exactly the same time It wouldn t be an enormous difference Omega Timing board member Peter H\\\\u00fcrzeler said in an email but when you think about reaction times being measured in tiny fractions of a second placing a speaker behind each lane has eliminated any sort of advantage for any athlete They all hear the start commands and signal at exactly the same moment There s also an ulterior reason for its look In a post September 11th world a gun on its way to a major event is going to raise more than a few TSA eyebrows even if it s a realistic looking fake Rather than deal with that the e gun can be transported while still maintaining the general look of a starting gun But there s still nothing like hearing a starting gun go off at the start of a race more than signaling the runners there s probably some Pavlovian response after more than a century of Olympic games that make people want to hear the real thing not a whiny electronic noise Everyone in the stands at home thankfully will still be getting that The sound is programmable and can be synthesized to sound like almost anything H\\\\u00fcrzeler says but we program it to sound like a pistol it s a way to use the best possible starting technology but to keep a rich tradition alive and that can be carried on a plane without the hassle, too

Sleep \",\"body\":\"There was a period in my life when I had a lot of problems with sleep It took me very long to fall asleep I was easily awaken and I simply wasn t getting enough of rest at night I didn t want to take medication and this led me to learn several tips and tricks that really helped me to overcome my insomnia Some of these tips I try to follow regularly Don t worry about not getting enough sleep Try not to worry about how much you sleep Such worrying can start a cycle of negative thoughts that contribute to a condition known as learned insomnia Learned insomnia occurs when you worry so much about whether or not you will be able to get adequate sleep that the bedtime rituals and behavior actually trigger insomnia Don t force yourself to sleep The very attempt of trying to do so actually awakes you making it more difficult to sleep Go to bed only when you are feeling really tired and sleepy Don t look at the alarm clock at night Looking at the clock promotes increased anxiety and obsession about time Body heating procedures Some studies suggest that soaking in hot water before going to bed can ease the transition into a deeper sleep Avoid oversleep Don t oversleep to make up for a poor night s sleep Doing so for even a couple of days can reset your body clock and make it harder for you to sleep at night Sex Sex is a well known nighttime stress reliever Healthy sex life enhances your relationship relaxes your body releases happy chemicals and even promotes wellness And it welcomes sleep Avoid alcohol as a sleeping aid Avoid the use of alcohol in the late evening The most common myth found among people is that they believe alcohol helps in the sleep But the fact is alcohol may initially act as sedative but it produces a number of sleep impairing effects in the long run Associate your bed and bedroom with sleep and sex only Don t watch TV eat or read in bed Although these things help some people sleep they can also give your brain the idea that bed isn t just for sleeping and this can keep you awake Naps If you suffer from insomnia try not taking a nap If the goal is to sleep more during the night napping may steal hours desired later

Houston Aeros Away Jersey These designers have thrust their Aeros into the upper tier of the American Hockey League with this curious creation Aggressive yet elegant 48 Florida Panthers 3rd Jersey Blue and darker blue aren t exactly Panthers colors but this jersey as a whole reeks of solid domination On the other hand it also screams Pittsburgh Penguins 47 Pittsburgh Pirates Negro League Jersey There s nothing like Heritage Week to bring back the old days The Homestead Grays clearly believed in simplicity and class Less continues to be more 46 Edmonton Oil Kings Military Jersey This Western Hockey League club is prepared to do whatever it takes to cement its name in history forever And that includes fashioning a Jackson Pollack esque display of paint madness More simply referred to as the Military Appreciation Jerseys Abstract art at its finest 45 Cincinnati Stingers Away Jersey This 70s World Hockey Association masterpiece can t possibly be gulped all at once It s too powerful Here is the rest 44 Kingston Frontenacs Don Cherry Jersey The Kingston Frontenacs are still several suits away from reaching greatness but the Ontario Hockey League just got a lot cooler with this

present brass evidently decided not to follow suit 39 Pittsburgh Steelers Throwback Jersey If these 80th season jerseys truly are inspired by bumblebees then due credit goes to those talented honey dwellers They may be tough on the eyes but these obtuse jerseys are a refreshing and necessary addition to the NFL Only in doses though 38 France New Away Jersey The stripe work may seem excessive but let s be real You can never have enough stripes Just as long as France doesn t get mistaken for a pack of referees 37 Anaheim Ducks Goldberg Jersey David Wright continues to amaze us with his potent disregard for the routine This is no regular Ducks sweater But it s clearly phenomenal 36 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey These 1912 1913 throwbacks give us another reason to love stripes But we

simply epic 33 California Golden Seals Jersey One of six teams added to the league as part of the 1967 NHL expansion the California Golden Seals never truly grasped the importance of winning on the ice they moved to Cleveland and became the Barons in 1976 They were clearly more focused on keeping their elegant white skates squeaky clean 32 Tampa Bay Lightning 3rd Jersey Released in 08 these silver trimmed knockouts are subtly intense It s refreshing The diagonal style lettering is a slight but necessary detail 31 Miami Heat Orange and Pink Jersey They only played in the ABA for two years 1968 1970 but that didn t keep today s superstars from remembering the Miami Floridians White pink orange black It might be too festive Though never too unique 30 Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 3rd Jersey

Connecticut Whale Jersey Since 2010 this AHL uniform has dominated the competition The Hartford Whalers esque feel gives the Whale a mighty advantage on camera 28 Los Angeles Kings Throwback Jersey

Loving the shoulder pad creativity at this moment although this wild flow may become a visual issue in the future 26 Portugal New Away Jersey The precise coloring cornered numbering and vibrant crosshairs make Portugal s new away kit one for the ages Quality over quantity 25 ZSC Lions Victoria Cup Jersey Founded in 1930 the ZSC Lions are clearly experienced in the art of victory But this Switzerland club proved they were more than just a stylish crew when they beat the Chicago Blackhawks in 2009 for the Victoria Cup trophy 24 Boston Bruins 3rd Jersey With a bear hogging the center there s little about this jersey that doesn t scream amazing We may despise Boston s hockey club but we love their Bruin 23 Washington Redskins Alternate Jersey These yellow and red studs are a

exuberant smile unable to contain itself Oh yes look closely The Scarlet Knights seem ready for battle 21 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey Word has it that this blue masterpiece was only worn for one year 1909 1910 but man what a year it was Time for a comeback 20 England New Away Jersey Rugby is already grueling enough but with a duel kit like this few others have a chance The staredown is classic 19 New York Rangers Heritage Jersey 18 Memphis Grizzlies Throwback Jersey As our eyes steadily adjust to the vibrant presentation it becomes clear that the Memphis Grizzlies have an intricate

kit has all of Western Europe in a euphoric state 16 San Antonio Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they

legendary NY scripted on their chest seals the deal Respect for baseball s former New York Giants 14 Quidditch Olympics Jersey The nerdiest sport on the planet just became perhaps the most fashionable as well with the introduction of their 2012 Summer Olympic tops Muggles may not possess the power to soar on broom sticks but they clearly know what it takes to look good 13 Oakland Athletics Throwback Jersey Just picture mustache extraordinaire Rollie Fingers sporting the green and yellow stirrups Truly kicking it old school 12 Chicago Blackhawks Throwback Jersey This 1936 inspired sweater does everything to escape the norm The tribal logo sets the tone while the cream white and red striping puts the finishing touches Epic 11 Texas Rangers Throwback Jersey This 1976 powder blue home uniform rests officially as one of the best to have ever graced the diamond The colorfully striped rims are a nice touch 10 Detroit Red Wings Throwback Jersey During their Cougar days Detroit s beloved franchise fashioned an intricate yet clean arsenal This eye pleasing presentation would define the Original Six and the NHL for years to come 9 Croatia New Home Jersey The design team designated to Croatia s EURO 2012 home kit seems to be simultaneously poking at greatness and insanity But let s be real this is pure genius 8 Ottawa Senators Heritage Jersey It must ve been tough for Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to contain his exuberance during this moment and we respect him for trying Sure the design is creatively perfect but it s the story behind the cloth that has us in a frenzy All it took was one suggestion from graphic designer Jacob Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would

Leicester Riders forward and national team captain Andrew Sullivan for the pink touch The glistening top reeks of class and the solid neck of aggression Nicely done 4 Cleveland Cavaliers Hardwood Classic Jersey We saw the Cavs sport a blue and orange top during LeBron James days but not so much this retro piece The 1970 s wine and gold look is a keeper 3 Ohio State Buckeyes Throwback Jersey In
